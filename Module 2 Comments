1.) "Did your programs run as expected?"
  For the most part, they did. There were some occasions when I forgot to change the visibility of my labels, and had to go back and change that property so the proper information was visible after user input.
2.) "What was the most difficult concept?"
  The most difficult concept I had to deal with while programming these applications was the scope of members. Because of classes being private, I couldn't access certain methods or variables in the way that felt most natural.
3.) "How long did it take to complete?"
  The total time I spent coding all the assignments for Module 2 was probably around three hours. Most of that time was spent refamiliarizing myself with how to create GUIs in Visual Studio, since it had been a while since the last time I had done so. The logic of the programs took very little time comparitively.
